# SeaportKit

Source code for app running at [seaportkit.info](http://seaportkit.info)

SeaportKit is a companion planning app for [Seaport](https://portal.pixelfederation.com/en/seaport/) game by [Pixel Federation](https://portal.pixelfederation.com/en/)

This app is a project made for fun. I built this as a hobby project because I play and enjoy Seaport and wanted to use it as an excuse to practice building web apps while enhancing my gameplay experience.

I track issues and planned enhancements on the [Issues](https://github.com/zsaffrin/seaportkit/issues) tab. Please feel free to submit and comment there with any ideas, feedback, or issues you encounter. Thanks for enjoying my work.
